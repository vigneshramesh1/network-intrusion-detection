5G-NIDD: A COMPREHENSIVE NETWORK INTRUSION DETECTION DATASET GENERATED OVER 5G WIRELESS NETWORK

This paper talks about how in this world of evolving networks, 5G and then 6G in the near future, AI is being enabled in networks and the incresed security risks associated with it. It talks about the intrusion attacks from AI being a huge threat to networks and the need to increase security to predict and combat these attacks. Coming to the main point of the paper, due to the lack of real time packet data in this AI-networks domain, it is hard to come up with a model that will provide good security in a real time scenario. The authors came up with a data set with real data that would be available in a fully functioning network. They examined the most common attacks and introduced those in the network and collected all the metrics that would be required to train a model to successfully classify if a given packet is malign or benign. Preparing data for machine learning-based intrusion detection systems entails capturing attack and benign traffic, performing post-processing steps such as GTP layer removal and conversion to network flows, labeling data, and applying feature selection techniques such as Pearson correlation and ANOVA F-scores. The third step is data normalization, which ensures efficiency when training ML models. Overall, the technique aims to produce a high-quality dataset for effective machine learning-based intrusion detection.
