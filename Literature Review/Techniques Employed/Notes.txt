1. Base Model:
   - The base model consists of pre-trained deep learning architectures, such as ResNet and Inception, which were initially trained on the source dataset (generated from the 5G lab testbed).
   - These pre-trained models were adapted to the task of intrusion detection, where they learned to extract features from network traffic data.

2. Convolutional Base:
   - In the transfer learning phase, the convolutional base of the pre-trained models was retained while removing the last three layers.
   - The convolutional base serves as a feature extractor, capturing relevant patterns and representations from the input data.

3. Additional Layers:
   - After removing the last three layers from the base model, additional layers were added on top to adapt the model to the target dataset (5G-NIDD dataset).
   - These additional layers typically include dense layers (fully connected layers) and possibly additional convolutional layers, depending on the architecture of the base model.

4. Fine-tuning:
   - During the transfer learning phase, the parameters of the convolutional base were frozen, preventing them from being updated during training.
   - Only the parameters of the additional layers added on top of the convolutional base were trained on the target dataset.
   - This fine-tuning process allows the model to adapt to the specific characteristics of the target dataset while preserving the learned features from the source dataset.

5. Training on Target Dataset:
   - The adapted model, consisting of the frozen convolutional base and additional trainable layers, was trained on the target dataset (5G-NIDD dataset).
   - Training involved optimizing the model's parameters to minimize a loss function, typically using techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam optimization.
   - The model's performance was evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness in detecting intrusions in the target dataset.

By building on top of the pre-trained base model and fine-tuning it on the target dataset, the transfer learning approach enables the model to leverage knowledge learned from the source dataset while adapting to the specific characteristics of the target dataset, ultimately improving its performance in intrusion detection tasks.

In the Deep Transfer Learning (DTL) approach described in the paper, the base model is augmented and fine-tuned for intrusion detection in the target domain (5G-NIDD dataset). Here's a more detailed breakdown of what was built upon the base model using DTL:

1. Convolutional Base:
   - The convolutional base of the pre-trained models, such as ResNet and Inception, is retained. This convolutional base serves as a feature extractor, capturing relevant patterns and representations from the input data.

2. Additional Layers:
   - After removing the last few layers from the base model, additional layers are added on top. These additional layers typically include dense layers (fully connected layers) and possibly additional convolutional layers, depending on the architecture of the base model.
   - The purpose of adding these layers is to adapt the model to the specific characteristics of the target dataset (5G-NIDD dataset). These layers learn to extract higher-level features and perform classification based on the features extracted by the convolutional base.

3. Fine-tuning:
   - During the transfer learning phase, the parameters of the convolutional base are frozen, preventing them from being updated during training. This freezing ensures that the learned representations from the source domain are preserved.
   - Only the parameters of the additional layers added on top of the convolutional base are trained on the target dataset. This fine-tuning process allows the model to adapt to the specific features and patterns present in the target dataset while leveraging the knowledge learned from the source domain.

4. Training on Target Dataset:
   - The adapted model, consisting of the frozen convolutional base and additional trainable layers, is trained on the target dataset (5G-NIDD dataset).
   - Training involves optimizing the parameters of the additional layers to minimize a loss function, typically using techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam optimization.
   - The model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness in detecting intrusions in the target dataset.

By building upon the pre-trained base model using DTL, the model can effectively leverage the knowledge learned from the source domain while adapting to the specific characteristics of the target domain, ultimately improving its performance in intrusion detection tasks in 5G networks.
