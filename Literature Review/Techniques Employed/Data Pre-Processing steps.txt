Data Pre Processing steps: 

Data preprocessing is a step in the data mining and data analysis process that takes raw data and transforms it into a format that can be understood and analyzed by computers and machine learning.

	1.Data quality assessment
	2.Data cleaning
	3.Data transformation
	4.Data reduction

In order to guarantee that raw data is cleansed, transformed, and ready for analysis, the context that is supplied delineates the critical processes that are a part of the data pretreatment pipeline. This is a synopsis of the breakdown:

1. Data quality assessment: - Determine how relevant, consistent, and high-quality the data is overall.
   - Spot irregularities including outliers, missing data, mixed data values, and mismatched data types.

2. Data cleaning: - Fill in the blanks manually or by disregarding tuples in order to correct missing data.
   - Use methods like clustering, regression, and binning to handle noisy data.
   - For text data, particular issues include eliminating duplicates and superfluous elements.

3. Data transformation
   - Aggregation: Consolidate information into a standard format.
   - Normalization: To ensure reliable comparison, scale data into a consistent range.
   - Feature selection: Determine which variables are most crucial to examine.
   - Discretization: For ease, group data into intervals.
   - Concept hierarchy generation: Organize features into hierarchical relationships.

4. Data reduction:
   - Attribute selection: To cut down on repetition, combine related features.
   - Numerosity reduction: To cut down on the quantity of data, use regression or other techniques.
   - Dimensionality reduction: Similar data is combined and made more manageable by using algorithms such as K-nearest neighbors.

All things considered, these procedures guarantee that the data is cleansed, restructured, and shrunk to enable effective analysis and subsequent procedures. For the data to be of high quality and useful for subsequent tasks like statistical analysis or machine learning, each stage is essential.
