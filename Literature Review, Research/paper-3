Exploring Emerging Trends in 5G Malicious Traffic Analysis and Incremental Learning Intrusion Detection Strategies

This paper was very useful because they used the same dataset that we are using to predict intrusion. They talk about how networks evolved from 1G to 5G and talk about the future expections and challenges. Their main focus was to use the 5GNIDD dataset to incrementally train machine learning models to give a better accuracy. What I also found interesting was the data processing phase where they described how they are splitting their dataset from the data avaialable from the two base stations in the 5GNIDD paper, and split train in such a way that the model learns from a variety of data because the type of data collected from both base stations is different. Incremental learning involves continuously updating a model as new data becomes available, which is crucial in dynamic and evolving environments like 5G networks. They evaluate mainly 2 models, SVM and logistic regression models to evaluate incremental learning-based approach. Their conclusion was that this incremental learning approach provides better results when compared to traditional ttaining methods.
