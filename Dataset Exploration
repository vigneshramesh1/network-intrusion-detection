Findings from dataset:

Packet and Byte Statistics: Columns such as "TotPkts" (total packets), "TotBytes" (total bytes), "SrcPkts" (source packets), "DstPkts" (destination packets), "SrcBytes" (source bytes), and "DstBytes" (destination bytes) can provide information about network traffic volume and potential patterns associated with various types of attacks. For example, certain assaults may entail extremely large packet or byte counts in comparison to regular traffic.
Protocol and Port Information: The "Proto" column identifies the network protocol used, which could be TCP, UDP, or ICMP. Understanding the distribution of protocols used in various sorts of attacks can be useful. Furthermore, port-related columns such as "SrcTCPBase" and "DstTCPBase" can indicate specific services or apps targeted by attackers.

Quality of Service (QoS) metrics: Columns such as "sTos" (source Type of Service), "dTos" (destination Type of Service), "sTtl" (source Time to Live), and "dTtl" (destination Time to Live) can provide information about service quality metrics and potential abnormalities in packet handling or routing.
Loss and Gap Metrics: Loss-related columns such as "Loss", "SrcLoss", and "DstLoss", as well as gap-related columns such as "SrcGap" and "DstGap", may indicate network congestion, packet drops, or anomalies that could signal attacks or network problems.
To get a conclusion on the target variable "Attack Type," investigate the relationships between these columns and the attack kinds. 

This can include a variety of machine learning techniques, such as

Feature Engineering: Create new features or combinations of features to better capture patterns associated with various assault types.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the correlations between features and the target variable to get insight into possible predictive relationships.
Classification Models: Train machine learning models (such as decision trees, random forests, or neural networks) to anticipate the type of attack based on the features presented.
Temporal Analysis: Use time-series techniques to examine temporal patterns and identify abnormalities linked with various assault types.
Using the rich information in your dataset and proper machine learning approaches, you may efficiently recognize and classify many forms of network threats.
