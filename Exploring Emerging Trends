This paper explains why 5g NIDD is the best dataset out there and why we need to use this datasets. 
The paper explains how attacks are increasing as the technology is advancing. 


Challenges of AI-based malicious traffic detection models in the 5G environment

a) High-performance processing of the detection models:
b) Traffic data security and privacy
c) High robustness of detection capabilities.:


Incremental testing is better suited for our dataset. Traditional approaches won't work for the dataset as attacks just keep increasing constantly. 
There are three different algorithms in incremental learning:
1. SVM
2. Logistic Regression
3. Perceptron
