	3. SPLIT DATASET
------------------------------------

	4. Check whether some columns are present for some attacks, create plots. 

o/p - value for imputation, make decision  
Do imputation check, do outlier check

	5. Normalize the value with mean = 0, standard scalar

	6. Mutual Information 

	7. PCA
