The best results we got is from KNN classifier. It provides 97.2 accuracy with FP-Rate of 2.2%. 
Dimensionality Reducution in this dataset as we have many un-important features. 
We also have class imbalance in this class. UDP has 61% records whereas ICMPFlood has 0.156% records. 
Feature Extraction and Feature Selection are part of Dimenstionality Reduction. 
PCA is recommended, we can also use Autoencoder. 
For class imbalance, we can use Synthetic Minority Oversampling technique. 
We chose multilayer perceptron which is deep learning model.
Support Vector Classifier is also a very alternative approach.
