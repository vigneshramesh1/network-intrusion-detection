In the above paper, learnt why one hot encoding is important. 
As we are planning to do data preprocessing with one hot encoding, read this paper. 
This paper talks about ordinal variable(first, second, third) and nominal variable(cats, dogs, tigers)
They mentioned there will be a natural relationship between ordinal variables and there is no 
Natural relationship between nominal variables. 

We need to use the variables and try to encode and decode it. 

1. Integer encoding: This encoding is very common for ordinal variables but doesnâ€™t work well for nominal. 
2. One Hot encoding:  This encoding is like converting the variables to a matrix form.
