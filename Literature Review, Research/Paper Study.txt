Introduction:
The paper presents an overview of network security principles, focusing on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability triad. It highlights the increasing prevalence of cyber-attacks, especially ransomware, and emphasizes the limitations of traditional security measures like antivirus software and firewalls. The paper introduces the significance of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and discusses the two main types: signature-based and anomaly-based.
Anomaly-based IDS, which models the normal behavior of a system to detect deviations, is explored in detail. The discussion points out the growing interest in anomaly detection due to its potential to identify unknown attacks. The text then transitions to the evolution of the 5G cellular network, emphasizing its faster speeds, low latency, and increased capacity.
The advantages of 5G are outlined, including applications in artificial intelligence, intelligent transportation, industrial IoT, virtual reality, and expanded cyber threats. The latter part of the paper delves into the potential security challenges posed by 5G, such as massive smart devices, increased network traffic, software flaws, and cyber threats. The need for innovative security solutions, especially using machine learning algorithms, is emphasized.

The literature review section summarizes various research works related to intrusion detection systems in the context of 5G. Researchers have explored centralized administration, machine learning techniques, and software-defined security to enhance network security. The paper highlights studies using diverse machine learning algorithms for intrusion detection and security in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellite-based 5G networks. Additionally, it discusses research on intelligent route decision-making, intrusion detection using MapReduce, and quality of service violation prediction.
The review concludes by mentioning a proposed trust-aware intrusion detection and prevention system framework for network defense, incorporating elements like MANET, cloudlet, and cloud service layer. The paper suggests that TA-IDPS outperforms traditional methods in terms of effectiveness. Finally, it introduces a framework for secure mobile cloud computing in 5G networks using intrusion detection system approaches, emphasizing the importance of well-protected web services and flexible IDS in the heterogeneous 5G environment.
